"# WaterPressureCalculatorSystem" 
add hydraulic pressure calculation system

- Implement core functions for water pressure calculations:
  * Water column height calculation
  * Pressure gain/loss models (pipe, fittings, reductions)
  * Reynolds number computation
- Add main program with user input interface
- Include constants for PVC and HDPE pipes
- Document formulas and assumptions in code comments

The system now calculates end-point water pressure 
considering static pressure and dynamic losses.
